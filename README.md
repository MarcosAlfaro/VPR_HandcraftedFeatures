# VPR_HandcraftedFeatures

Overview
--------

This repository contains code and experiments for Visual Place Recognition (VPR)
using handcrafted local and global image features. It provides tools to extract
features, create CSV datasets, run experiments (feature-based and learning-free
evaluations), and collect results for several benchmark datasets (360Loc, COLD).

The code will be updated soon.


Notes
-----
- The repository contains multiple experiment scripts for different dataset
	configurations; check the top-level scripts to choose the right one for your
	use case.
